# eth101

My First code project in solidity

Requirements for the projcet was to create a multi signature wallet where:

- Anyone should be able to deposit ether into the smart contract

- The contract creator should be able to input (1): the addresses of the owners and (2):  the numbers of approvals required for a transfer, in the constructor. For example, input 3 addresses and set the approval limit to 2. 

- Anyone of the owners should be able to create a transfer request. The creator of the transfer request will specify what amount and to what address the transfer will be made.

- Owners should be able to approve transfer requests.

- When a transfer request has the required approvals, the transfer should be sent.
